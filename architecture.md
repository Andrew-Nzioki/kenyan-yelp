1. **domain.go**
- Contains your core business objects and rules
- Pure business logic, no infrastructure concerns
- Independent of how data is stored or transmitted



2. **dto.go** (Data Transfer Objects)
- Defines how data is sent/received in your API
- Handles API validation rules
- Can omit sensitive fields from domain
- Used for request/response shapes


3. **entity.go**
- Represents how data is stored in database
- Contains database-specific fields
- Handles data persistence concerns

When to Use Each:
1. Use **domain.go** when:
   - Defining core business objects
   - Implementing business rules
   - Need objects independent of infrastructure

2. Use **dto.go** when:
   - Defining API request/response structures
   - Need to validate incoming data
   - Want to hide internal fields from API

3. Use **entity.go** when:
   - Working directly with database
   - Need database-specific fields
   - Have different storage requirements

For a small project, you might only need domain.go and dto.go. Entity.go becomes important when your database structure differs significantly from your domain model.
